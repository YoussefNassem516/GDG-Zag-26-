            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! I’m a passionate web developer with a strong foundation in front-end technologies. My journey into
                web development began three years ago when I discovered the power of creating beautiful, functional
                websites that can reach millions of users worldwide.</p>
            <p>I specialize in building responsive, user-friendly interfaces using <strong>HTML</strong>,
                <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong>. My approach to development focuses on clean code,
                accessibility, and performance optimization. I believe that every line of code should serve a purpose
                and contribute to an exceptional user experience.</p>
            <p>Throughout my career, I've worked on various projects ranging from small business websites to large-scale
                web applications. Each project has taught me valuable lessons about problem-solving, teamwork, and the
                importance of continuous learning in this ever-evolving field.</p>
            <p>When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new web technologies, contributing to open-source
                projects, or sharing my knowledge through blog posts and tutorials. I'm particularly interested in
                modern CSS techniques, JavaScript frameworks, and web accessibility standards.</p>
            <p>My goal is to create digital experiences that not only look great but also make a positive impact on
                users’ lives. I’m always excited to take on new challenges and collaborate with fellow developers to
                push the boundaries of what’s possible on the web.</p>
